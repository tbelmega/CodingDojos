Sample implementations of some Code Katas

Solving a Code Kata is not actually about solving the problem - the problem is in fact not meant to be challanging.
Doing Code Katas is about practicing. Practice your languages, your techniques, your IDEs, your hot keys - everything, that makes you a better and more productive programmer.
You can do the same Katas over and over again. If you have the chance, grab some other people and solve the Kata as a Coding Dojo. Every other programmer might know some tricks worth adapting.
